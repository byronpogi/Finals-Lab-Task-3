# Finals-Lab-Task-3
This portfolio demonstrates how to learn MySQL by designing and managing a product database. The process involves creating a table, setting up constraints, entering valid data, and modifying table structure using straightforward SQL commands.

##Step 1: Build a Product Table
-Create a table called products with the following columns:

-id: Set as the primary key with auto-increment.

-product_name: A text field with a maximum length of 100 characters, which cannot be null.

-price: A decimal value.

##Step 2: Apply a Constraint
-Add a CHECK constraint to ensure that the price is greater than zero.

##Step 3: Insert Valid Data
-Add entries with positive prices, such as:

-Laptop – 999.99

-Smartphone – 599.99

-Tablet – 299.99

-Keyboard – 19.99

-Mouse – 14.99

-Desk Lamp – 24.99

-Speakers – 9.99
Exclude any products with negative prices.

##Step 4: Modify the Table
Update the product_name column to allow up to 120 characters.
